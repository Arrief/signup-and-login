# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
Once cloned from Github, in the terminal run ```npm install``` inside **both** the /frontend and /backend folders.

Inside a MySQL database, import the **users.sql** (or copy & paste its content in the MySQL terminal, using a database, for creating a table and inserting a test user to begin with).

Then rename the **.env.sample** file to just **.env** and replace the fake values inside with your MySQL data and credentials.

Lastly, run ```npm start``` again in both the /frontend and /backend folders and keep both terminal tabs/windows open all the time.
